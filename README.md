This project analyzes an Electronics Retail Sales dataset to evaluate sales performance across regions, product categories, and salespersons using analytical SQL techniques. It applies aggregations, window functions, ranking, and pivoting to track monthly trends, compare performance against averages, and identify top-performing products and employees. The goal is to generate business insights that support decision-making in sales strategy, inventory planning, and performance evaluation.
